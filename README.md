### DESCRIPTION
<hr>

The idea behind the making of this project is to cover the aspects of **Atmanirbhar** Bharat and **Post COVID World**. In order to protect ourselves from the COVID-19 Pandemic, we need to follow certain protocols such as maintaining social distancing, wearing face masks, washing our hands regularly, etc. Not only that, we must keep ourselves updated with the number coronavirus COVID-19 positive, recovered and death cases in our country and the area we are residing in. So, it becomes increasingly important to check if the people in the crowd wear face masks and maintain social distancing. <br>
In order to ensure that the COVID-19 protocols are being abided by, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework - “Co-Yudh” is being developed that comprises features like - **detecting face masks** using the Transfer Learning approach in which the MobileNet2 model is used which is trained on the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD). Further, the trained model is evaluated on the novel dataset - Mask Evaluation Dataset (MED). Another features include **detecting social distancing** where Yolov4 model is used. This is an easy-to-use framework that can be installed in various workplaces and can serve all the purposes to keep a check on the COVID-19 protocols in the area. Our preliminary results are quite satisfactory when tested against different environmental variables and show promising avenues for further exploration of the technique. The proposed framework is a more improved version of the existing works done so far. <br><br>

## INSTALLATION PROCESS
<hr>

<mark style="background-color: gray;">**NOTE**: Python3, git and tensorflow needs to be installed on the system.</mark>

 => Open your Terminal / CMD 

```

git clone https://github.com/CO18325/COV_PROJECT.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
(Application would be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

```


## SCOPE OF PROJECT
<hr>

* As the coronavirus COVID-19 cases are rising day by day, it becomes the responsibility of us as the citizens to take certain steps to control this Pandemic until vaccines are made available to the people. The virus will continue to affect lives on a global level. So, we wanted to contribute in a small way that could help the organizations ensure that certain things could be tackled without the help of their workforce.

* As all the organizations cannot follow the **‘work from home’** policy, there is a need to follow certain protocols in workplaces too. It becomes risky for the security guards to guard at the entrances of the workplaces. So, to reduce such risks, we have designed an application that can be installed at the entry points as well as the premises of the workplaces or public places.

* The **FACE MASK DETECTOR** could be used at the entry points and can be combined with the automatic door systems. So, the entry of the people will be only if they wear face masks. Also, the face mask detector can be installed in CCTV cameras in a workplace/public place that could keep a check on people if they are violating the face mask protocol. Heavy fines can be kept based on that.

* The **SOCIAL DISTANCING DETECTOR** could be used in CCTV cameras of an organization to make sure that this protocol is being followed in the premises of the organization. If the social distancing protocol is being violated, it will start to give a warning. Hence, the entire picture could be viewed by the organizations’ members via the CCTV monitor. If there is a continuous warning, then the person who is violating this protocol could be caught.
